    - The Library page displays a list of library items (texts) with pagination.
    - Each library item is displayed with its metadata (title, author, theme, short content).
    - There are buttons for viewing full text, editing metadata, and deleting the item.
    - There is a search bar to filter library items by title, author, or theme.
    - There is a button to add new texts to the library manually.
    - Pagination controls are available at the bottom of the library listing.
